## Overview
 This challenge looks like a simple in the beginning, but as I started working on it, I realize it's complicated than I thought, specially the number click responce. I add a little bit javascript for the button responce so it will change the number of rate. But all in all I have fun building it and hope you guys like it.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

First I started building responsive layout of the project, then hover effect and the , then the reponsive button.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learn how to use the CSS custome properties and to be more creative and find other ways to code stuff with the help and advices of my fellow programmers. I want to learn more and to be able to build stuff as fast as I can. Please I do appreciate comments and advices. Thank you.
